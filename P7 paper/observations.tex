\subsection{Observations}
During the evaluation, it was observed that the participants generally seemed to understand the concept of creating framings. After working with the FCT for a short while, they appeared to appreciate the concept. Some of the participants expressed a positive attitude when trying the tool, saying things like \textit{"This is coooool, guuuuys"}, \textit{"This is nice"}, \textit{"I like this a lot!"}.

Pelle: less is more. One way to preview is enough; I can live with that. Be the camera vs. snapshot: one method is enough.

Artists talked positively/vividly about the framings they wanted to create in the creative phase, e.g., "I want to create a creepy-looking framing with the feeling of being watched from above". This indicates that they had faith in the tool.
