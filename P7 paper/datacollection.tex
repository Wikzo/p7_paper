Each question's response choice were on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Furthermore, they were asked whether they preferred to \textit{'Be the camera'} or taking a \textit{'Snapshot'} for adjusting cameras. They were also asked how useful they thought the instant preview features were. The response choices were "not useful", "somewhat useful", "very useful", "didn't use any of them", and "don't know". To highlight the best features in the tool, the participants were asked to name their favorite feature from a list of 7.
