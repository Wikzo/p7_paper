\subsection{Data Collection}
While the test participants tried FCT, their two monitors were recording using Open Broadcast Software \cite{obs_cam}. Additionally, a webcam recorded the face of the participants, together with the audio. An observer also wrote notes during the evaluation. For the questionnaire, the participants rated themselves on the following statements using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep]
\item \textit{I felt empowered using this tool.}
\item \textit{I felt restricted using this tool.}
\item \textit{I felt I got the tasks done quickly.}
\item \textit{I felt the tool allowed me to complete the tasks well.}
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, they were asked whether they preferred \textit{be the camera} or \textit{snapshot} feature for adjusting cameras. They were also asked how useful they thought the preview features were. The response choices were "not useful", "somewhat useful", "very useful", "didn't use any of them", and "don't know". To highlight the best features in the tool, the participants were asked to name their favourite feature from a list of 7.
