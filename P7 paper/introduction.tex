\section{Introduction}
We will collaboratively work on a video game with a Bachelor group at The Animation Workshop (TAW) in Viborg. Our goal with this work is to develop a camera tool for this particular game production that can facilitate the development of the game. Qualitative analysis on game companies, developers and the students at TAW will be used to identify how the camera tool should be and will work as basis for our design decisions. In order for us to get sufficient information to continue this project, a questionnaire for game developer programmers was made and the answers have been coded into categories. We also visited and interviewed two game companies to see how they deal with these problems in practice. Lastly, we made observations when we worked with TAW. All data and observations from these three sources have been triangulated and a final problem statement has been formed.
