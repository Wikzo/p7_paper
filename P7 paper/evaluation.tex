\section{Evaluation}
%Give artists the task to make a video in a certain scene using some specific features, both in Unity and in Maya. We can then compare their performances, and if the two performances are significantly close, the tool was a success.

%Video and audio recordings. Time spent on tasks. Few questions about usability and experience.

%(Hypotheses - not sure yet?)

Tasks found from participatory design



To evaluate the usability of the FCT, we conducted a study at The Animation Workshop. The goal was to observe if the FCT allowed the artists from the participatory design group to use the tool both effectively and creatively. Furthermore, to offer a wider perspective, we used a control group without any prior experience with the FCT. This was done to investigate the applicability of the tool with artists that had no prior experience with working with neither games nor the camera tool.

%\item To find out if the FEELS tea's mental models of the camera system match how the system actually works.
%\item Compare other artists from TAW 3rd year using the camera system with the FEELS team.
