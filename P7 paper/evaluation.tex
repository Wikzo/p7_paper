\section{Evaluation}
%Give artists the task to make a video in a certain scene using some specific features, both in Unity and in Maya. We can then compare their performances, and if the two performances are significantly close, the tool was a success.

%Video and audio recordings. Time spent on tasks. Few questions about usability and experience.

%(Hypotheses - not sure yet?)
To evaluate the usability of FCT we conducted a study at The Animation Workshop. Our goal was to observe if FCT allowed the artists from participatory design to use the tool creatively. Furthermore, to offer perspective, we had other unbiased artists with the same education degree use FCT.

%\item To find out if the FEELS tea's mental models of the camera system match how the system actually works.
%\item Compare other artists from TAW 3rd year using the camera system with the FEELS team.
