\section{Evaluation}
%Give artists the task to make a video in a certain scene using some specific features, both in Unity and in Maya. We can then compare their performances, and if the two performances are significantly close, the tool was a success.

%Video and audio recordings. Time spent on tasks. Few questions about usability and experience.

%(Hypotheses - not sure yet?)
A test was carried out to find 

What do we want test.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To find out if the FEELS tea's mental models of the camera system match how the system actually works.
\item Compare other artists from TAW 3rd year using the camera system with the FEELS team.
\end{enumerate}


%Figure \ref{fig:test_overview} shows the criteria for the two testing groups \footnote{This will not be in the final paper; it's just for helping you to understand what we mean.}
