\section{Experiment}
Give artists the task to make a video in a certain scene using some specific features, both in Unity and in Maya. We can then compare their performances, and if the two performances are significantly close, the tool was a success.

Video and audio recordings. Time spent on tasks. Few questions about usability and experience.

(Hypotheses - not sure yet?)
