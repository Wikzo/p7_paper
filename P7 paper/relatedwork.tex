%Camera Path Animator 3.0 (Unity asset store).
%Camera system that follows the character but also focuses on showing the environment - Used in the game God of War.

During researching, a tool called Camera Path Animator 3.0 by Jasper Stocker was found \cite{unity_camTool}. It's can be used for creating animated cameras within Unity (see Figure \ref{fig:unity_path_cam_tool}). As the name suggests, it works by animating the camera along a specified path, which can have various shapes (e.g., Bezier and Hermite curves). The tool is primarily targeted towards creating cameras that move linearly along a set path, i.e. for use in a non-interative cutscene. It provides various ways of inserting, moving and deleting points, as well as settings that can be changed, such as field of view, speed, interpolation type and easing. Additionally, it has a event system for triggering certain events at certain points in the path.
