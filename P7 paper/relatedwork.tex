Research has been conducted in the field of automatic camera movements in virtual environments. In 3D computer animation, an virtual environment (containing elements such as lights, objects and buildings), are rendered in frames from a specific point of view. This is a complex process that involves technical and artistic tasks, typically requiring the work of several professionals for a long time period \cite{burelli_automatic_2014}. Developing a system that makes the camera animation automatic can be beneficial at both a professional level (to reduce cost) or at an amateur level (to increase quality). Systems that emphasize automatic behaviour have been implemented \cite{bourne_constraintBased_2008, burelli_automatic_2014}; these use an automatic approach for controlling a virtual camera driven by an intelligent approach. The focus for the Framing-Based Camera Tool is mostly on the artistic elements. Therefore, it is important that the artists are able to create the framings themselves. Hence, an automatic approach is not feasible.

The main requirements of a camera tool in most games is that it can go from one camera setting  (A) to another camera setting (B), depending on player position or certain events. For instance, A and B can be different in position, rotation and field of view.
%By looking at games with emphasis on its visuals and environments, it was found that the camera changes its position, rotation and field of view. 
Figure \ref{fig:InterpolationExample} shows an example of how the camera interpolates between three positions.

\subsection{Camera Tools}
The tool Camera Path Animator 3.0 \cite{unity_camTool} can be used for creating animated cameras within Unity. As the name suggests, it works by animating the camera along a specified path, which can have various shapes (e.g., Bezier and Hermite curves). The tool is primarily targeted towards creating cameras that move linearly along a set path, i.e. for use in cinematic sequences. It provides various ways of inserting, moving and deleting points, as well as changing settings such as field of view, speed, interpolation type and easing. Additionally, it has an event system for triggering certain events at certain points in the path.

%The God of War video game franchise for the PlayStation systems has also made notable use of their camera systems. The developers call the system Rail Driven Cameras and consists of a 'rail' that will be placed in the game world. A camera is keyed in both ends of the rail, and the camera will then animate between them as the protagonist moves along the rail. % Det her føles pølse, ikke meget at skrive om det og super unscientific

In a behind-the-scenes documentary, the developers behind the PlayStation game series \textit{God of War}, talk about the importance of being able to frame the scene \cite{gow_camera}. Depending on the context, it is important for them to frame the scene, so players know where they should be heading next. They use camera zones to determine what area the player is in and then activate the corresponding camera for that zone.

\subsection{Participatory Design}
Participatory design has been defined as the participation of users in the design process of a system that is to be implemented in an organization \cite{kensing_participatory_1998}. Here, users correspond to workers in the organization. By involving users in the design, their skills, experiences, and interests are taken into consideration, thereby increasing the likelihood that the system will be useful to them.

According to participatory design researchers, it is important that there is an active cooperation between the designer and the user \cite{kensing_participatory_1998}. This results in the designer gaining knowledge of the user's current work practices, and the user gaining knowledge of the technology being developed. It is also important that users take an active part in the analysis of needs, selection of technology, design and prototyping, as well as organizational implementation.
