Three scenes was constructed for the test. The first was an environment with simple geometry scene. The second was used in the first part of the test when participants were introduced to the camera tool and had to complete 5 tasks. The third level was for the creative part of the test when participants had to envision the camera movement in an environment and then implement it.
