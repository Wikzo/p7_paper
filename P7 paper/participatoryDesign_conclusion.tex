\subsection{Participatory Design Conclusion}
It's important to design and iterate with the users' current workflow and mental models in mind. By building on top of their pre-exisiting skills and knowledge, one can ease the learning curve by creating a design that is close to what the users are already familiar with. The users should become co-creators, but you should not forget that \textit{you} are the designer. You should listen to what the users say they want, but even more so try to understand what they really \textit{need} and \textit{why} they need it.
