\section{Summary and Future Work}


A limitation of this project was the study of creativity, i.e. how the artists were able to get an idea, sketch it out on paper and then implement it with FCT. The test participants had a limited amount of time to do this. It also raises the question how to judge creativity and quality. One approach is to let field-professionals judge the end results of the framings anonymously \cite{sadeghi_artist_2010}. We encourage more research into this field.
