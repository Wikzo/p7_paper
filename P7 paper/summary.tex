\section{Summary and Future Work}
\textbf{(write about summary)}

A limitation of this project was the study of creativity, i.e. how the artists were able to get an idea, sketch it out on paper and then implement it with FCT. It raises the question how to judge creativity and quality. One approach is to let professionals in the field of camera animation judge the end results of the framings anonymously \cite{sadeghi_artist_2010}. We encourage more research into this field.
