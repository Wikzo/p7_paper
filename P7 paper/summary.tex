\section{Summary and Future Work}
We have defined the basic requirements needed for a framing-based camera tool built specifically for a game where the player character's movement is restricted to a  path. Based on our evaluation, the proposed camera tool lets the user design and create a dynamic camera animation and proved versatile enough to accommodate creative freedom and even usages not originally envisioned. 

A limitation of the evaluation was the study of creativity, i.e. how the artists were able to get an idea, sketch it out on paper and then implement it with FCT. It raises the question on how to judge creativity and quality. One approach is to let professionals in the field of camera animation judge the end results of the framings anonymously \cite{sadeghi_artist_2010}. We encourage more research into this field.
