\subsection{Principles and Guidelines}
General findings that can be learned from this study. Could be something like the "180 degree rule" of games. Examples: that the barycentric interpolation works better than triangulation; that you should at maximum have four cameras; that cutting between multiple cameras confuses the player if the cutting speed is less than X, etc. In short, something the reader can use after having read the paper.
