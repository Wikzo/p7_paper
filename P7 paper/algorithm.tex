\subsection{Interpolation Between Framings} \label{interpolationChapter}
Each influence point is placed on the player path. The interpolated camera settings ($f_{i}$) are a function of the player's position $P_{pos}$, which is used to interpolate between the camera settings $c_1$, $c_2$ of the two influence points on the path closest to the player's position, with a weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ based on the positions of the influence points.
\begin{equation}
f_{i} = f(P_{pos}) = w_1c_1+w_2c_2
\end{equation}
The two closest influence points are found by a linear search from the player's position along the path segments in both directions. The distance travelled in both directions until encountering an influence point is logged $i1_{dist}, i2_{dist}$.
\begin{equation}
w_1 = {d_1}/(d_1 + d_2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
w_2 = {d_2}/(d_1 + d_2)
\end{equation}
In the case there is no influence point in one direction, the distance in that direction is zero. The artist is further able to manipulate the weights, $w_1$ and $w_2$, for each camera setting through the graph editor. Evaluating the curve at $w$ produces a new weight, $w_{i}$, for each camera settings.

%In pseudo code, this gives us the following interpolation for each camera setting:
%\begin{equation}
%f_{i} = i1_{cam_{i}} * w_{i} + i2_{cam_{i}} * (1-w_{i})
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Path-Based Slider-Preview}
For the slider preview, a player position, $P_{pos}$, is computed from the given slider value, $w_s$, from 0 to 1, and the influence points of the start and end framing ($i_{start}, i_{end}$).


\begin{equation}
P_{pos} = f(w_s, i_{start}, i_{end})
\end{equation}


Drawing from the same logic as in the interpolation, a linear search is performed from the influence point of the start framing $i_{start}$ following the path in both directions, logging the total distance travelled until the influence point of the end framing $i_{end}$ is encountered. Using the total distance between the start and end framing, the interval [0,1] is mapped to the sequence of the encountered influence points between the start and end framing. For slider values between two influence points, the position $P_pos$ is computed using linear interpolation.


%Each time the search passes another influence point, it logs it $i_{n}$ together with the distance travelled $i_{n_{dist}}$. All distances $i_{n_{dist}}$ are normalized $i_{n_{distNorm}}$, with the total distance travelled $TD$ set to 1. The slider-weight $sw$ now fits in an interval between two influence point distances $i_{before_{distNorm}}, i_{after_{distNorm}}$). The possible player character position $P_{pos}$ is then calculated and used as the argument in $f_{i} = f(P_{pos})$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%P_{pos} &=& i_{after_{pos}}\left(1 - \left(sw - i_{before_{distNorm}}\right)\right)\nonumber \\
%&&\mbox{}+ i_{before_{pos}}\left(sw - i_{before_{distNorm}}\right)
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $i_{n_{pos}}$ is the world position of $n$ influence point.
