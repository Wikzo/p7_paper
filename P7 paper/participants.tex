\subsubsection{Participants}
Two groups of participants took part in the evaluation: three artists from the participatory design group and three artists outside the participatory design group. Both groups were students from The Animation Workshop \cite{taw_degrees}. Since the first group was involved in designing FCT, they had previous knowledge of the tool. The three other artists knew nothing about FCT and were used as a control group to avoid this bias.
