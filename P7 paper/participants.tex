\subsubsection{Participants}
Two groups of participants took part in the evaluation: three artists from the participatory design group and three artists outside the participatory design group. Both groups were students from The Animation Workshop. Since the first group was involved in designing the FCT, they had previous knowledge of the tool. The three other artists who knew nothing about the FCT were used as a control group to avoid this bias.
