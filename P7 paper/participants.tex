\subsubsection{Participants}
Two groups of test participants took part in the evaluation: three artists from the participatory design group and three artists outside the participatory design. Both groups were students from The Animation Workshop. Since the first group were involved in designing FCT, they had some knowledge and experience working with games. Additionally, they had already seen and tried previous iterations of FCT. Three other artists were used as a control group. They knew nothing about neither FCT nor game development.
