\subsubsection{Participants}
Two groups of test participants took part in the evaluation: three artists from the participatory design group and three artists outside the participatory design group. Both groups were students from The Animation Workshop. Since the first group were involved in designing the FCT, they had some knowledge and experience working with games. Additionally, they had already seen and tried previous iterations of the FCT. Three other artists who knew nothing about the FCT were used as a control group.
