\subsection{Findings}
Through the participatory design exercises, we found that the artists were very familiar with Autodesk Maya \cite{MayaSource}. To ease the learning curve, we decided to design the tool with the overall structure of Maya in mind. This doesn't mean that the tool should directly copy how Maya looks and works, but that, when designing the camera tool, we should keep their established mental models \cite{mentalModels} in mind. Since the artists have been working with Maya and other 3D modelling software, they have a certain understanding and expectation of the animation process. As a designer, you create conceptual models for the system. Therefore, it's important to be aware of the users' pre-existing mental models. Another key finding was the fact that most of the artists were working with two computer monitors. This enables them to have the main interface on one monitor, while the other can show secondary windows such as graph editors or an additional preview window showing the camera's point of view.
