THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT ABSTRACT!


The goal of this project was to create a camera tool in Unity, which can be used by non-programmers. The system was be designed specifically for a team of six third year students of The Animation Workshop (TAW) in Viborg, who are developing a 3D point-and-click game in Unity for the iPad. The camera tool uses interpolation based on player position.

The tool successfully gave the participants the ability to easily set up cameras both quickly and nonrestrictively. The tool proved to be easy enough to be used for quick sketching and broad enough for final setup. Further user experiments are needed to make the interface more streamlined and intuitive to ease workflow. For a fully featured tool, it would further need to be able to handle forked paths, cuts, cutscenes and camera effects.
