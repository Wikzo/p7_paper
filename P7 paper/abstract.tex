The framing-based camera tool (FCT) is a tool for games where the player character moves on a pre-defined path. Through participatory methods, it was found that artists prefer working with keyframing animation, known from traditional time-based animation. This concept has been incorporated in FCT the form of framings. A framing consists of a an influence point and a camera. Depending on where the player is located, the main camera will interpolate between the framings.
