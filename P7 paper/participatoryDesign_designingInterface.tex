\subsubsection{Adjusting the Camera}
In 3D animation software, there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing. An example of this is how to position a camera in a scene. This can be done by manually adjusting the X, Y and Z position of the camera; moving it by dragging a handle tool; or, alternatively, by using the the \textit{Look Through Selected} feature \cite{maya_lookThrough}. During the initial observations, it was clear that many of the artists at The Animation Workshop preferred this feature. This concept was translated directly into the camera tool. Using the \textit{be the camera} feature (see Figure \ref{fig:beTheCam}), the artists can place their camera by navigating the scene in Unity with the \textit{Flythrough mode} \cite{unity_flyMode}.

\caption{Pressing the green button puts the user in a special mode where the selected camera inherits positional and rotational data from the scene camera. To exit the mode, the user has to press the button again (which now spells "Exit the camera" in red).}
\label{fig:beTheCam}
\end{figure}

Another way to position the camera in Maya is by using an aim-vector control point \cite{maya_camAim}. The artists at The Animation Workshop used this to quickly make the camera aim at something in the scene. This concept has also been designed for the camera tool (see Figure \ref{fig:aimPoint}).

\end{figure}

%It was discovered that none of the artists knew how to use a standard Unity feature that lets the player fly around with the scene camera as if they were playing a first-person game ("Flythrough Mode", \cite{unity_flyMode}). The artist were excited about the discovery of this feature. One artist perceived the standard way of moving around in Unity as confusing, while another stated that the way of moving the camera is exactly like in Maya. After testing this ourselves, we concluded that the movement controls in Maya and Unity are indeed very similar (except for the "Flythrough Mode"), which means that the artists should ideally be comfortable with navigating in either of the applications.
