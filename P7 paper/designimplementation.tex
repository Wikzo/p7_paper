\section{Design and Implementation}
Design requirements (from preliminary study + demands from director at TAW)	
Describing how the system works (e.g. interpolation, placement of markers, trigger zones, etc.)

\subsection{Design Overview}
Some key implications from the exercises are discussed below.

People at Viborg use two screens

Positioning of the camera

Fast preview.

\subsection{First Iteration}
Implementation
What did we do
Interface?
dds
Interpolation?
sdf

Test
With the prototype done, the artists sat down in front of a laptop with  second screen connected ...tried using the 


Exercise 3: First iteration.
When all important design features had been implemented into a prototype we had the (three) artists try it out.
