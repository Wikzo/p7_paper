\abstract{
%This paper will investigate the speed reading technique known as Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), as well as how it relates to other topics, such as eye movement and modes for reading. The goal of this paper is to analyze contemporary theory and literature and discuss the different points of view in regards to speed reading.

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation is a speed reading technique that presents words quickly one at a time. This is done to eliminate the need of saccading. In order to increase the reading speed, it's important to examine the optimal recognition position, as well as the processing speed of different words. The goal of this paper is to analyse contemporary theories and literature to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of RSVP. Even though it might be possible to read very quickly, it raises the question of how much it impacts the reading comprehension.}
