\section{Introduction}
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a common speed reading technique in which words are only presented one at a time in the same place. It is a speed reading technique that, among other things, eliminates saccading between words. In conventional reading, jumping from one word to another is done by saccading, which has a penalty in the time used.

However, these methods can be criticized, as other factors come into play when reading. One such factor could be the goal of reading a text, such as whether you are reading it to learn, understand or memorize it. Depending on the goal, speed reading has its strengths and weaknesses. To understand these strengths and weaknesses, this mini paper sets out to investigate these topics.
