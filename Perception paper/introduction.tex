\section{Introduction}
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a common speed reading technique in which words are presented to the reader one at a time. It is a technique that, among other things, eliminates saccading between words. In conventional reading, jumping from one word to another is done by saccading, which has a time penalty.

However, these methods can be criticized, as other factors come into play when reading. One such factor is the goal of reading a text, whether you are reading it to learn, understand or memorize it. Depending on the goal, speed reading has its strengths and weaknesses. This mini paper sets out to investigate these.
