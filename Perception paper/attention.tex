%\subsection{Attention}

A fixation on a given word is not needed in order to read it. Your attention can be shifted to targets in or outside your foveal vision \cite{eyeMovement}. It is even possible to focus your attention on multiple targets simultaneously \cite{simAttention}. But it is not possible to make a saccade without shifting attention to the fixation \cite{eyeMovement}.
