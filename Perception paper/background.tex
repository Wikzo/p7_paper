\section{Background Knowledge}
\subsection{Eye movements}
\subsubsection{Saccades}
(velocity, fixations durations, latency)
Different types of saccades (pursuit - cricket example, vergence, vestibular, etc.)
Habitual eye movements (apping)
\subsection{Optimal Recognition Position} \label{ORP}
Write stuff here that can be used in for explaining Spritz later ...


Meta-guiding reading (using a pen to keep focus)
\subsection{Attention}
\subsection{Modes for reading}
("gears" - depending on context, you switch "gear"):
Read for memorize
Read for learning
Rauding (sentential integration, lexical + semantic) - most optimal
Skimming (semantic encoding)
Scanning (lexical access? using memory)
Reading rate (WPM) - rauding is the best?
Cognitive speed vs. reading speed
E = AR (E: Efficiency, A: Accuracy, R: Rate)
Sub-vocalization
