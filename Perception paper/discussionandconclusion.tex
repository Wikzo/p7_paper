When comparing the different reading processes to RSVP, an assumption can be made that RSVP only incorporates the rauding process. Neither skimming or scanning are supported, as they require peripheral vision. This also excludes the possibility of using schema, since readers . Furthermore, idea remembering and fact rehearsal cannot be accomplished with RSVP, since they require regression. 

Since RSVP seems limited to only one reading process, process flexibility is mostly likely not supported either. A compensation for this has however been made by Spritz, since their RSVP algorithm takes into account the processing time for each word when calculating the duration for each word. Whether or not the reading efficiency is the same as when using process flexibility remains to be tested.
